# House Price Prediction Dataset

This directory contains information about the dataset used for the house price prediction project.

## Dataset Source
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and can be found at [Kaggle House Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data). It includes various features related to house characteristics and their corresponding sale prices.

## Dataset Structure
The dataset consists of the following key files:
- `train.csv`: The training dataset containing features and target prices.
- `test.csv`: The test dataset containing features without target prices.
- `sample_submission.csv`: A sample submission file for the competition.

### Key Features
Some of the important features in the dataset include:
- `LotArea`: Lot size in square feet.
- `OverallQual`: Overall material and finish quality.
- `YearBuilt`: Original construction date.
- `TotalBsmtSF`: Total square feet of basement area.
- `GrLivArea`: Above grade (ground) living area square feet.
- `GarageCars`: Size of garage in car capacity.

## Preprocessing Steps
Before using the dataset for training the model, the following preprocessing steps are recommended:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and remove duplicates.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that may improve model performance.
3. **Normalization/Standardization**: Scale numerical features to ensure they contribute equally to the model training.
4. **Categorical Encoding**: Convert categorical variables into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding.

Ensure to follow these steps to prepare the dataset for effective model training and evaluation.
